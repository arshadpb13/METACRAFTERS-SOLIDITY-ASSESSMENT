## METACRAFTERS-SOLIDITY-ASSESSMENT



## Project: Create a Token
## MYTOKEN
This Solidity program is a simple token contract that demonstrates the basic functionality of an ERC20-like token, including minting and burning capabilities. The purpose of this contract is to provide a foundational understanding of how tokens operate on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description
The MyToken contract allows users to create a cryptocurrency with the following features:

Public variables to store the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply.
A mapping to track the balances of token holders.
A mint function to increase the total supply and a user's balance.
A burn function to decrease the total supply and a user's balance, with validation to ensure the user has sufficient tokens.
This contract serves as a stepping stone for those looking to learn about token standards and smart contract development on Ethereum.
## Getting Started 
##  Executing the Program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps to get started:
1. Access Remix: 

- Go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

2. Create a New File:

- Click on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar.
- Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol).

3. Copy and Paste Code:

  - Copy the  code from MyToken.sol file  into your new file:
   
4. Compile the Code:

  - Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
    
 -  Ensure the compiler version is set to 0.8.18 or another         compatible version.

 -  Click the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

5. Deploy the Contract:

- Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.

- Select the MyToken contract from the dropdown menu and click the "Deploy" button.

6. Interact with the Contract:

- After deployment, you can call the mint and burn functions by entering the required parameters and clicking the respective buttons.
